# WaterHackWeekAdministrative

This repo contains tasks and issues to be resolved for organizing the Water Hack Week event. Each issue should have specific description and related to a single topic (no checklist; purely descriptive). The project management team will then address the issues by creating tasks and collaborator assignments in github project pages. 

The operations follow a Kanban-, Trello-, or agile-style project management workflow.
